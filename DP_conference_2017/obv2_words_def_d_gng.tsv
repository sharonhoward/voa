I met a man with these casks; he asked me to carry them to the Strand, and offered me a shilling for it. I said I would; I carried them along; he followed me. The watchman held up his lantern and asked me what I had there? I said I did not know. I laid them down and turned round to look for the man, but could not see him. The watchman laid hold of my collar, and said I must go along with him. I said I would go without his holding my collar. They took me next morning to the justice. I told them where I was quartered. They took me to the house of the landlord, and he owned the cask."	188	"guilty"

The bricks came in a cart, apparently full. He asked me where they were to be set down. I shewed him. He put down 150 bricks, and said, Master, where is the money? I said, Where is the receipt?

I was taken down to the watch-house: I was continued there all night.

I asked her how it was possible? says she, have you not got out silver spoons and milk pot? says I, how can I? she said she was only joking; she said she would run away, and would stay no longer; I told her she should not go away, nor I neither, till her father came home: I called Mr. Elphinstone, and told him the story that I believed the place had been robbed; the publican came over, and he was the first, I believe, that entered the house after the robbery; I sent for Mr. Grant, who came in presently: there is one Mr. Cooper that lays in the same room where this property lay; Mr. Grant told me he knew who the thief was; I asked him if he suspected me? he said no: at last he divulged his mind, that he suspected this Cooper, who lays in the room where the money was, but works up stairs; the prosecutor got a search-warrant, I never quitted the room; I wanted to make water; I would not stir because there should be no suspicion; Cooper's room was searched, but nothing was found; Mr. Grant said I might as well go, and I went to Bow-street; there a man, named Gregory, came in and enquired into the affair; the prosecutor felt the lump that was at the bottom of my pocket before we went to the Justice's he said it was not worth ripping; I did not know what it was myself; after pulling all the things out of my pocket, Gregory said here is something here; I said I had observed it before; the prosecutor ripped it, and if it had been in the pocket he would not have made a word of the matter, but being concealed in the lining, he said I believe I know something of this handkerchief; I said I am sure you do not, it is a rag I carry meat in sometimes when I go to work; he said he would ask his wife to be more thoroughly convinced; I said I wish you would, I can bring witnesses where the handkerchief came from; I waited in the tap-room till he returned; he said we shall hear further about it, and he spoke very freely of this Mr. Cooper; however, we all went to the Justice's, and went through our examinations. Concerning this handkerchief, I had it, so help me God, (there is a just God that knows the secrets of every thing, I would not tell a lie on this account) I had it in my possession the Saturday before; I imagine I put this rag in at the top part of my pocket which was ripped, and it must go in between the lining and the cloth: on the Sunday morning I said to a person who will be here, says I, give me a needle and thread, this hole pothers me; I sewed up the hole, and by that means did not recollect any thing of any thing being between the lining and the bottom of the coat; and when this place came to be ripped, no more thought of any thing of the kind being there than any thing; I saw directly when it was pulled out what it was; he swore that was the very handkerchief his money was counted in; she said she knew it to be hers by the border; I imagine they washed it; they swore to it a second time after keeping it in their own possession: the girl starts up, says she, I know it by the holes in it; so I was committed. I hope you will take it into consideration: how can any person think I could rob this man of his property, and make away with it, and few this rag in the lining of my coat?

The evening in which this matter is stated to have happened I went to see the play, it was Macbeth, the house was filled early, and hearing it mentioned that there was no more room at that side, I was going to another part of the house, when I was accosted by the prosecutor, who said, Sir, you have got my watch. I told him I had not, and that he should be satisfied of it in any manner he chose. There were several persons present at the time. An altercation took place, during which a by-stander cried out, There is a watch on the ground. This was at some yards distance from him. The prosecutor ran, but whether he stooped himself, or it was given him by a by-stander, I cannot say; but he took it, and declared it to be his. It has been stated, that when he accused me, I extended my hand, as if I was offering something to some person; whether I did or not I cannot take upon me to say; but I trust that it will not be considered as an unnatural position for any person so accused, to extend his arm or hand. Perhaps it will be more reasonable to imagine, that an endeavour would be made to conceal them, if the accusation had been just; and I trust, Gentlemen of the Jury, that it will be worthy your most serious consideration, that while this circumstance is mentioned in order to criminate, the prosecutor has acknowledged, at the same time, that he saw nothing in my hand, saw me drop nothing, or give any thing to any person whatever. It has been stated, that during the altercation he received some violent treatment, and though he has acknowledged it did not proceed from me, yet an endeavour has been made to turn it to my disadvantage. I most humbly beg leave to observe, that in consequence of the alarm a croud came, and hearing such a charge made, and seeing two people disputing, both decently dressed, and much alike in heighth, and not immediately knowing which was the accused person, some, more violent than the rest, might have laid hold of him, as the others did of me, until they were satisfied which was the accuser. This I humbly conceive, and this alone, gave rise to the violence complained of; and though it has been laboured to impress the Court, with an idea that it proceeded from accomplices, yet I humbly hope, that, where there are no solid proofs to establish such an idea, it will not be received; and therefore that in this, as well as in every other circumstance of surmise or conjecture, it will be deemed as just and charitable to suppose for as to suppose against the prisoner; and I trust too, that the justice and humanity of this Honourable Court will not allow that a man, though he may be unfortunate enough to have a blemished character, shall be made responsible for offences which others have committed, or that a surmise or supposition will be suffered to supply the place of clear convincing proofs. Whether those that have appeared on this occasion are of that kind or not, would be presumption in me to say; I humbly hope they are not. But I must beg leave. Gentlemen of the Jury, with all humility, to call your attention for a moment to another subject, which, though it has not, and ought not to have, any connection with the evidence, may, without much care, have weight in deciding my fate. It has been my misfortune to have suffered much from ill-natured report, and from wanton invention, at a time too, when I can truly say, that I had been using my best endeavours to merit commendation instead of reproach; and I thought to have had it in my power to have given convincing proofs of this to the Court, from a gentleman in whose employment I have been for some time, but who is now absent on his affairs in Ireland. Desirous of having his testimony, which I knew must be favourable to me, I thought to have requested of the Court, to defer my till the following sessions; but being told that the absence of witnesses which was character, was not in general deemed sufficiently material to defer a trial, I have omitted troubling them with the application. And although, under these circumstances of imprisonment and an impending trial, yet they have not secured me from the effects of inconsiderate wantonness. Circumstances have been related of me which never happened, and others have been cruelly exaggerated. I do not say this in order to excite your compassion, but to allay inflammation. Gentlemen, prejudice sees through a glass, which makes things appear quite different from what they really are; you best know, Gentlemen, whether, in consequence of any thing of that kind, your minds may have contracted a biass unfavourable to me. If, upon reflection, you think that they have, I am sure you will carefully examine your breasts; and if upon a cool and impartial consideration of the evidence alone, you think or doubt, that it is not of that perfect and substantial nature, which should induce you to find a verdict against any other person, I am sure you will not against me, since you must be fully sensible, that in such a case it would be a conviction from prejudice, and not from evidence. But, Gentlemen, I have an implicit confidence in your goodness; and I trust you will not only lay aside all passion and prejudice yourselves, but that you will be pleased to make a candid allowance for the effects of it in others; and that you will proceed with that cautious and tender regard, which good men feel when the fate of a fellow-creature is depending, and which will insure satisfaction to your minds, when words cannot be recalled, and when the power of prejudice is no more.'"	1048	"notGuilty"

As my case has been multiplied in horror, though with submission I think, in comparison, far beyond even the sufferings of my accusers: I admit, in justice, that I should have experienced the hardships I have suffered in the process of the law against me, till my innocence could be proved: but while I revere the law of my country, which presumes every man to be innocent, till proved guilty; yet I must reprobate the cruelty with which the public prints have abounded, in the most scandalous paragraphs, containing malicious exaggerations of the charges preferred, so much to my prejudice, that I already lie under premature conviction, by almost an universal voice. I chearfully resign my case into the hands of this tribunal, whose peculiar province and character is to reason on evident motives and circumstances; and which, I trust, will not suffer the fate of a fellow creature to be determined by popular prejudice; and for want of due consideration, to be narrowed within the bounds of a party. I rest my case to the decision of an English jury; and in hopes of being able to establish my innocence in your opinion, I most seriously appeal to the Great Author of Truth, that I have the strongest affection for the happiness and comfort of the superior part of this creation, the fair sex, to whom I have in every circumstance that occurred in my life, endeavoured to render assistance and protection.

Henry Dundas came in; it was the mode of proceeding to petition; she did not come, being disappointed: next, it is very evident, on her own information, that there was business carried on by me after these supposed charges; and she tells you she has employed me afterwards: now, is it competent to your reason and understanding to suppose that she should put any further faith or confidence in a man to carry on any further business of that sort; it is a very clear matter to me, this is a piece of business brought with intent to answer some private purpose, and she has got some person to inform Mr. Shelton of it; he, as a gentleman, undoubtedly took up the matter to prosecute; that I admit to be very right and just; but those accusations have no ground; it is party against party; it is morally impossible, where two people are concerned, and where the business is directly between party and party; she might have as well have assured the Court that she paid me 50 l.; it was out of my power to confute her. My Lord, I have acted throughout this business with no intent, either directly or indirectly, to take advantage of this woman whatever; I did every thing as far as lay in my power in the business; and in consequence of which I must observe, that my wife was the person who got the petition to the Queen into the Countess Dowager of Effingham's family; it was sent by her, and presented; whether it had any effect, I cannot say; she got a violent cold by so doing, and has never since been able to do the domestic duties of the family: I have three children, and one of them blind: I have only to say, that, upon this charge only, were I this night summoned before the great tribunal of the awful seat of God, to answer for the deeds I have done in this life, and had no other charge to answer for, I am sure I should be perfectly happy; I am totally innocent; I never received any sum or sums of money on those pretences whatever; I have received sums of money as necessary for a person acting for six weeks, going here and there, backwards and forwards, from Shoreditch to Charing-cross, to meet this good woman at different public-houses; undoubtedly her mind was very uneasy; I put her to no expence on that account; she has often declared she was fully satisfied with my conduct: I now address myself to your candour and benevolence in this business; I am perfectly satisfied that I have done every thing to serve the woman.

As I was lately an officer in his majesty's navy, I was obliged to be often at Portsmouth, I became there acquainted with one Macdonald at the Blue Posts, where I lodged, he did not lodge there but in some private apartments in the town. Almost as soon as our acquaintance commenced he told me he was going to America; among other intercourses, we went together to play at billiards, where at other places as well as at Portsmouth, we played for small sums; I won a very large sum of him at Portsmouth, and he applied to me for fifty pounds, which he lost; and then applied to me for another fifty pounds, and as I had won the greatest part of his money that he had lost since the time of our acquaintance, I lent to him; and I lent him a third fifty pounds. As he was going out of the country I thought it would be proper to have some security, and he said he would give me some bills. In about a week or a fortnight after I went to Northampton, soon after my arrival there he made a remittance to me of three checks, one of five pounds, one of ten pounds, and one of fifteen pounds, all of them drawn by Mr. Thomas Exton on Messrs. Hammersley; I soon after returned to town, and on Sunday the 31st of August, I paid one five pound check to Mr. Lewis's servant, and the other two I sent by a servant to Messrs. Ransom's, the bankers, and all of them were actually paid at the banker's, and no questions have ever arisen on them to my knowledge; from this treatment of Macdonald, I had reason to believe I was treating with a person of honour; on my return to town I met with him at the New Exchange coffee house, when I mentioned to him my desire of having the remainder of the debt being paid, and he gave me three other checks, purporting to be drawn as before, which I immediately sent for payment by a servant, but on their being presented Mr. Moreland stopped them, and desired to see me, and I went immediately to Mr. Moreland, he then informed me that my checks were forged; I then said, I would endeavour to find Macdonald; I informed Mr. Moreland by whom they were paid to me. I did not see Macdonald that night, but I see him some time the next morning at the coffee house, when I stated the circumstance to him, and he expressed a considerable passion, and with apparent resentment set off to go to Mr. Moreland's, and returned in great haste in about half an hour, telling me he had explained the matter to Mr. Moreland's satisfaction, I then thought that the alarm that Mr. Moreland had made on my mind was an unjust suspicion, and Mr. Macdonald then took from his pocket a letter, which he informed me he had received from Mr. Exton, by that day's post, containing two checks signed by Mr. Exton; and they were signed different than those he gave me. I looked at the two last checks, and from the circumstance of the two first checks being paid, I relied on Macdonald's veracity; of these two last checks. one was for twenty-one pounds, payable to Mr. Ryland, or bearer, and which has never been negociated; the other was for ten pounds, payable to Mr. Brooke, or bearer, and which I paid to Mr. Lewis, Saturday, the 13th of September, and I received of him in exchange, three pounds sixteen shillings, and which I understand was presented by him, or his servant, to Messrs. Ransom's, who stopped payment, and I was apprehended on the usual charge of uttering it, knowing it to be forged. I shall here beg leave to call to your consideration, the evidence on the trial for the first indictment, one of the witnesses proved that I paid it to him for money due to Mr. Lewis, for goods, which he then objected to taking, on a supposition that it was not a good one, on which I told him if it was not good I had two others of the same, and to take it home, and if his master did not like it I would take it back, on that I called on him on the Tuesday or Wednesday following for the change, which he gave me, the bill having been paid. It was also proved by Mr. Francis Heslop, that some considerable time after paying the five pounds, on being sent for to Mr. Ransom, I went there without any hesitation; I related the facts as I have to you to day, and so satisfied was Mr. Moreland of my innocence, that he did not detain me, and on the last trial so satisfied were the jury of these facts, that they acquitted me of the crime laid to my charge."	861	"guilty"

The first checks were paid the latter end of August 1794. On Sunday, the 31st of August, I paid one to a servant of Mr. Lewis's, who objected to take it; my answer was to him, that if it was not good I had two others of the same; in regard to the other three checks which I sent by a servant to Mr. Moreland, the banker's, and who desired to see me, I went to Mr. Moreland's without restraint; Was this the act of a guilty mind? had I a guilty conscience, should not I rather have sled? Mr. Moreland was so well convinced of my innocence that he suffered me to go at large; from Messrs. Ransom and Co. I never sled, but immediately sought after Macdonald, and never changed my lodgings to the time of my apprehension; taking all these circumstances together, is it at all surprising, that any suspicion that I had entertained against Mr. Macdonald should vanish? that I did not question Mr. Macdonald, is certain; that I am not guilty myself, is unquestionable; for if I had known they had been forged, I would not have paid two checks to Mr. Lewis, and after I had done so I would not have gone home to my lodgings, solely to give the prosecutor an opportunity of apprehending me; would any one of you have acted so? surely not. The great difficulty by witnesses to prove the negative, is a hard matter; add to this, I am not twenty years of age, and Mr. Macdonald is a great deal older, and no wonder that he easily prevailed on my credulity."	309	"guilty"

They said, I was not the person; I was retained in Mr. Horsey's custody three quarters of an hour; then they came back, and the woman said they would make it up for two guineas; and the man says, you d-mned b-ch, I will have the expences of the indictment. She made no reply, but he tells her, positively swear, right or wrong, he robbed you; for which afterwards they made me out a bill of five pounds; I told them I would not go nigh them; then they wanted six pounds one shilling and sixpence; I then said, if I did any thing illegal I would go through the law.

Now Mr. Hill knows that my name is John Portees, but he chuses to alias me, because he wishes to defame me. Mr. Hill, the whole time I was with him was in the constant habit of pawning every little trifling thing in the house; I have known the house many times bare of every thing, without a table-cloth, or a tea-spoon in the house. Mrs. Hill can neither read nor write, and she has given me the tickets to pick out particular things for her when she has wanted them out, and I have seen even the ticket of a child's cap, that had been pawned for four-pence, and they always pawned things in other people's names, particularly in the name of Mrs. Williams, of Tottenham-court-road, a person not of the best character in the world; two children used to fetch and carry these things backwards and forwards. When they have had company, they have been obliged to borrow tea-spoons, because their own were in pawn; I only came down here last night between eleven and twelve o'clock, if I had had further time, I should have had some witnesses to prove what I have already stated. When I was taken up, I had Lord Kenyon's subpoena about me, to attend the Grand Jury, at Westminster, to give evidence upon a bill of indictment against Mr. Hill, for perjury; he said to a person that is now in Court, that if I went to give evidence against him, he would take me up upon that warrant, and as soon as I came out of the Grand Jury room, I was taken up upon that warrant. With respect to pawning the book in question, I solemnly declare to your Lordship I never did; and, with respect to the second witness, a very few days indeed will shew what a situation he will be in, on account of some transactions at Manchester; there have been several persons up from Manchester to take him, but have not yet been able to find him."	365	"notGuilty"

I trust I shall be able to prove what I have here stated. Since I came to England, I have conducted myself with the greatest property, but, unfortunately, when a man has once appeared at this bar he is ever looked upon with suspicion; I therefore throw myself upon the candour of your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, convicted they will act with that impartiulity which so peculiarly characterises the Juries of this country."	222	"notGuilty"

Crane, and made a blow at his breast with a dagger, which he avoided; he was making another blow at him in the breast apparently, I then said hold of the poker, which laid upon the drawers, the same poker which the deceased bad drove me out with, and in that instant I threw it at him, just as the dagger was coming towards Crane's breast; the poker entered just under the nose; at that instant he let the dagger fall which he had in his hand; he pulled out the poker with both his hands, and made a blow at Crane with it, he then immediately ran towards the window, which was open, and certainly would have jumped out if Crane had not caught hold of him and pulled him back; Crane and one or two more laid hold of him, and brought him down stairs instantly, he never fell down at all; and the witnesses will tell you there were no chairs or tables at all moved."	611	"notGuilty"

First of all, let us take a slight view of the solicitor for the prosecution, Mr. Loaring, he has been telling you, that I had a lodging in such a place, after that, in such a place, and after that in such a place. Can he prove to you that I bore a bad character at either of those places? Can he prove to you that I defrauded him or any other person, at either of those places? Can he prove to you that I have committed forgeries, or that I have circulated bad notes at either of those places? If he cannot prove that, where is the utility of his speaking? He might as well have told you that I was born in Birmingham, and after having been at school, was apprenticed, and at the expiration of that apprentiship, became a journeyman; it would have been as fully applicable, or he might as well have told you, that Paris was the metropolis of France, or that the Old Bailey did not stand upon London-Bridge. He did not tell you that I was a clerk in the Bank; he did not tell you that I was employed to go about searching every place to discover forged notes; no, he did not tell you that, because it would have militated against himself; but I leave it for you to draw the inference upon his character, while I attempt to proceed a little farther. I will now take a view of the Counsel for the prosecution, and in doing this, I cannot but feel myself astonished to see a man stand up in this Court with all his strength, with all his might, with all his logic, attempting a stab a fellow-creature to the heart; he has been traducing, vilifying me, stating that he has not the least doubt of proving my guilt by such and such a circumstance, by such and such evidence; and he has not least doubt, that the facts will be proved; forgery cannot be proved against me, but he hopes to cast me upon circumstances. Gentlemen, be careful, consider the situation you are in, consider the eye of God is upon you, and likewise consider that you have this day taken your oath to do me justice. Has the prosecutor proved to you, that I committed the forgery? Has any evidence proved that I circulated it, knowing it to be forged? Have they proved the least appearance of what I now stand charged with? Gentlemen, your reason must tell you, no; no man's life ought to be taken without the clearest proofs, particularly for forgery, for as soon as a man is cast for forgery, you may as well shoot him dead at the bar, for there is no respite, all is then over; suppose either of you had a son, most likely some of you have; suppose it to happened that your son had taken a Bank-note, and he pays it to his tailor or his doctor; it turns out to be a forged one; it is traced to his possession, he is taken, doubled ironed, and tried for the forgery; what would be your feelings, as fathers, upon that occasion? Would it not be your prayer to Almighty God, that his innocence might appear; would you not sympathize with his situation, would you not feel for him? Certainly you would, and what would be your opinion of that Jury, who should find a verdict against him for nothing at all? should you not think it head that your son should lose his life for nothing? Can any reason upon earth be brought forward to justify such a verdict? No, Gentlemen, your reason will tell you, no, it is impossible. Gentlemen, be careful, let me exhort you to bring your understandings to the test of truth. Has the prosecutor believed to you, that I am guilty of the circulation of the notes of which he wishes to convict me upon circumstances where the evidence is not clear? If you think as I do, and as every body must do, that the Counsel for the prosecution has not proved the least appearance of guilt, you cannot, consistent with your oaths, this day, find me guilty; you cannot, consistent with the principles of justice and humanity; you cannot, consistent with the duty of Christians this day take away my life. Gentlemen, I have oftentimes heard, that men have lost their lives upon circumstances. This, in my opinion, is extremely cruel, because, if circumstances are ever so pointed, if they are ever so obvious, if they are ever so clear. they only amount to probability, and probability implies at least a kind of uncertainty, and where there is no proof, gentlemen, you ought to be very careful; but even supposing a man ought to lose his life upon circumstances, here there are no direct circumstances at all; for if I am to lose my life because I pay away a note, you, and every person present, might stand at this bar for the offence - offence I cannot call it, but you are as liable, gentlemen, to take a bad note as I am, and if that is the law of this country, don't let England set herself up as an examples to other countries. The Bank would with to convict me upon slight circumstances. With respect to the letter,they would wish to urge it as an evidence of conscious guilt, nothing can be more ridiculous, in my opinion, than this. When I was first taken into custody, I was taken to the House of Correction, and there the Governor (you have most likely heard talk of him) took me into the kitchen, and desired all the turnkeys to watch me closely; no person was suffered to speak to me; my sister came twelve miles from the country to see me, but was not permitted; she went to the justice, and he did not think fit to give an order; I have a brother, who came one hundred miles, and he, with difficulty, got admittance; after I had been there some time, the Governor took me into his private closet, as he calls it, and said, Mr. Holt, you are in a serious situation, depend upon it you will lose your life; you had better tell me all, and you shall have an attorney and counsel, and the best advice, for, says he, the Bank-directors are so severe, that they will. prosecute a person for only having about him a forged note; I told him I had nothing to fear, and therefore as to discovering any thing to him, I could not; I was informed they meant to do all they could to convict me; this induce me to write this letter, in order to make my escape, though I was innocent, knowing I had such a body to contend against, and having heard that men had been executed upon such circumstances, I began to be alarmed, which was the cause of my writing that letter, but after that, I had several opportunities of getting away; I was placed in the kitchen where the keys were kept, and I could have let myself out, as well as all the prisoners confined in the prison, if I had pleased, but I was determined I would trust to Providence and take my trail. It is very true, that I lived with a female, and in order to get rid of her, I took this other lodging. As to the materials that have been produced, they are such as I use in my business as a varnisher. Gentlemen, whatever may be your verdict, it will not make me unhappy, as I am conscious of my own innocence. I do not conceive it to be necessary to say any more upon the subject."	1369	"notGuilty"

The fact is, that without the smallest premeditation or reflection on my part, but from I know not what kind of sudden and momentary impulse, occasioned by extreme distress, I entered the house in which this melancholy event took place, and shewed the pistol, thought certainly without any intention of firing. - In the already extremely agitated and disordered state of my mind, I was, in all probability, as far as I can judge of my own sensations at that moment, so affected by the entrance of a person who came in after me, that I involuntarily pulled the trigger, but without pointing the pistol at the prosecutor, or any other person. This, to my conception, is the only possible way of explaining so very extraordinary and unpremeditated an act. Of the extreme agitation and disorder of my mind, some idea may be formed, when I declare, that almost perishing with hunger, (for I had taken no nourishment whatever during two days), a friend less wanderer by day, obliged at night to seek repose within the dismal walls of unfinished houses, unacquainted with a single individual to whom I could make application for relies, ashamed to beg, and destitute of every other resource, I was absolutely driven to such a pitch of desperation, that I had positively determined, about two hours before, in the Park, to put an end to my miserable existence, had loaded my pistols for that purpose, and should actually have perpetrated the horried deed, had I not been prevented by the presence of a lady and her two servants, who were at that time walking in the Park. In short, I am fully convinced, however unable to prove it, that I laboured under a kind of mental derangement at the time: that such was the idea of the keeper of the Poultry Computer, when I was taken into custody, is evident both from his own declaration, and his ordering a strait waistcoat to be put upon me; at all events, the firing of the pistol certainly was an act in which my will had not for a moment the smallest concern; for I do most solemnly declare, in the face of this awful tribunal, before which I am now arraigned, and in the presence of that omniscient Judge before whose still more awful bar I am shortly, perhaps, to appear, that it never was my intention to fire. What object, in fact, particularly at so early an hour, and in so public a street, could I expect to attain? what advantage could I hope to derive from it? I could not but foresee that the report of the pistol must necessarily alarm the neighbourhood, and cause my person, in all probability, to be seized: the act itself proves, that there could be no rational intention; and I solemnly aver, that there was no intention at all of pulling the trigger, much less to fire at the prosecutor. I am informed, and it has but this morning reached my ears, through the charity of a gentleman, who, from compassion, interested himself in my unfortunate case, that I stand accused before the public of actual robberies committed in shops and private dwellings, under circumstances similar to those of the charge I have now to answer to: this, I am told, has been asserted in the public newspapers; and yet from my ignorance of the language of this country, and my close imprisonment together, I have been so far from being able to answer the groundless and cruel report, that I was utterly ignorant of its existence. I throw myself upon the candour and humanity of the Court for protection from this source of prejudice: I am sure the justice and liberality of the English nation will hold it enough for a poor foreigner to answer to charges legally brought against him in a strange land, without being prejudged by the effect of calumnies which he has no means of disproving. For the charge upon which my life is now in your hands, my rash and criminal conduct had given but too much colour, though I certainly did not fire at the prosecutor, or meant for a moment to hurt him; but that I ever, in any other instance, offended against the laws of this country, in any degree, I most solemnly deny; and if any man can alledge the country against me, I desire him to stand forward, and am ready to meet death if it be found, that except in this instance, I ever attempted to invade the property of another, or gave a moment's alarm to any man for his personal safety. Whatever character may belong to the act now in question, it was my first and only action which can be taxed with criminality in the eye of the law of this or any other country; I had suffered enough before, but had not before attempted to relieve my sufferings at the expence of any moral obligation."	982	"guilty"

I will endeavour to be as collected in my reason as possible, though unhappily for me, at certain times and seasons, I am particularly under heavy pressures of mind, which my wife well knows, and was well aware of it. That I have committed the horrid deed laid to my charge, I have no wish to deny, any more than I have to avoid the dreadful punishment that awaits my guilt, to that I am resigned, nor was it my wish from the unfortunate moment of my crime, to evade justice; but that I committed the deed maliciously against my poor child, who was the victim of my fatal passion, I solemnly deny. I loved my child, and I hope no one will think it was done in malice. I solemnly declare it was not, in the presence of God, before whom I now stand, and before whom I must shortly appear, and whom I hope will direct you and guide you in your decision upon me in the course of this day; for malice I had none, I loved her most tenderly, and love to the child, wishing her not to be from me, strange and perverse as it may seem, is owing chiefly the sad cause that brings me here this day. I am married to a second wife, by whom this was our only daughter; we had long known each other before our marriage, when I was in better days; and when she and I were the wife and husband of others, I thought I could be happy with her, but I did not know the nature and temper of her family; I found afterwards the friends and family with which she was connected, thought her marriage to me degrading. As her family disliked the union, she knew me well, why did not she avoid having me. What has occurred was done through the height of passion and despair, as disputes and controversies had taken place between us for ten years, in which unhappily both were in fault too much so. Those disputes were often carried to a pitch of fury, and what still more exasperated me was, that those she called her friends, always sided with her whether right or wrong; and, what is still worse, they would put their hands to mischief; and many of them, I am sorry to say, were strenuous professors of religious principles. May the Lord forgive them and me, and take me to himself! Our disputes at last ended in a mutual agreement to separate, and the child I so tenderly loved was to go with her mother. This my unhappy temper and feeling could not bear, and led me to the fatal resolution that neither she nor I should have the child, by committing the horrid deed of putting an end to her life, in the manner I have done. I pray God Almighty to forgive me, and to direct you in it, and may this spectacle I now stand be a warning to those who form second marriages, if they meet with double families, to have more love to their duty than giving way to intemperate disputes that may lead them, as they have done me, to acts of desperation and vengeance beyond the controul of reason and reflection! If my wife was present, she could vouch and prove that it was impossible I could ever have deliberately executed such an act; she could vouch that my disposition is not cruel, and that my resolutions have always led me to the side of virtue; but as here I stand, in the presence of God, when unfortunately under agitations of mind or provocations of temper, I am not really the same man at all times, and my weakness, under such circumstances, when I have been under the most resolute purposes for good, have very frequently led me into excesses of frenzy. I have often felt it, and I have wondered at it; in cool moments it has often astonished me how I could do so. There was a circumstance that happened to me at one time; my own business failed me, it has often failed me, and I frequently, when I could get no work at my own business, used to strike out to out-door work; but once in particular when I could get no work, forced by distress to apply for relief at my parish-workhouse, there was something that disappointed me, I had come too late in the day, and because I was disappointed, I broke as many windows as cost the parish four pounds, and yet the parish-officers did not punish me, though they might. I have no more to to say, but I hope God will of his infinite mercy forgive me; I must die a spectacle of sin, disgrace, and horror."	825	"guilty"

In the awful situation I now stand, poor, and destitute of the means of obtaining the assistance of counsel, I feel it incumbent on me to submit to your attentive consideration, the substance of my defence in writing. On Friday the 8th of February, one day previous to this unhappy occurrence. I was discharged his Majesty's service by the Board at Chelsea College, on account of a liver complaint, and had that day only left the hospital, in which I was confined for the last three months. On the next day (the day stated in the indictment) two comrades visited me at my lodging, they staid and drank with me and my wife till past nine at night. We were joined at half past seven by two female servants from the Duke of York's school, who partook of porter and spirits with us until half past ten, when they took their departure. Soon after they had left us I asked my wife the reason of her bringing porter from the public-house instead of spirits, which I had ordered her to fetch with four glass tumblers. At this she instantly flew in a passion, words arose, and a violent quarrel took place. She told me she thought porter was quite sufficient for me, and upbraided me in very insulting language for presuming to send for liquor to make punch. I said to her, if any other person had requested her to bring the spirits and tumblers, there was no doubt but she would have readily brought them. She was rather intoxicated, and I myself was nearly tipsy, provoking words were used on both sides, and at length I slapped her in the face with my open hand. She sat down on the bed and cried, but quickly after got up and abused me in still more gross and irritating language, which urged me to chastise her again. I struck her several times with a small piece of whalebone which I found lying on the floor, such as women wear for a busk-bone, Mrs. Lewellin interfered, but I told her to sit down and say nothing, or probably I might serve her the same. My wife still continuing to provoke me, and my passion increasing in consequence thereof, I struck her again, when, striving to get from me she fell over a trunk that was placed on the floor. She complained of being hurt by the fall, and requested me not to beat her again, I replied I would not provided she would hold her tongue, she ceased scolding me for several minutes, and then began again calling me blackguard and other opprobious names which induced me again to have recourse to the whalebone. At this time a man on passing the door called out and said if we did not make less noise he would fetch the watchman, upon which I asked my wife if she heard what the man had just said, and if she would be quiet and say no more, she answered yes, and in a short time afterwards we retired to bed. On the next morning, (Sunday,) Mrs. Lewellin came into my room and found my wife and me in bed; she wished us both a good morning, and said she was glad to find us reconciled and in good humour. In the course of this morning my wife complained of being unwell, I asked her if I should send for a doctor that she might be bled, and she answered yes if I thought proper, I immediately sent a boy for Mr. Lanskear, who attended himself in the course of an hour and bled her. I enquired of Mr. Lanskear his opinion of my wife's complaint, who told me he thought her in no danger; but if I would send to his house he would prepare some medicine for her. My wife, however, informing me she found relief from bleeding, and saying there was no occasion for any medicine, there was none got. I continued at home with my wife upon the most affectionate terms from the Saturday, when the lamentable quarrel took place, until the Friday following, when I told her I should go and seek after some employment, and return home on the Sunday week following. She said if it were not for her black eyes, that rather disfigured her, she would very gladly accompany me. At the time I left her, eighteen shillings was all the money I had; out of which sum I gave her eleven. I did not imagine when I left home my wife was in a dangerous state; she eat and drank as usual, and appeared cheerful. I returned home on the day promised; went to my lodging, enquired for my wife and was told by Mrs. Lewellin she was gone to another lodging. Shortly after I was taken into custody, informed that my wife was dead and buried, and that I was suspected of being the cause of her death. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. Whether my dear unfortunate wife came by her death through my treatment or not, is now left for your impartial judgement; but this much I can most conscientiously affirm, that if blame be imputable to me, I had no intention to incur that blame at the time the melancholy quarrel took place. I had no malice in my heart: no premeditated design upon her life; on the contrary I loved her most dearly, nor have I ever ceased to mourn her premature and untimely end. Passionate, and given to abuse she certainly was - she had hers: - I too had mine. My passion, by her grossly abusive, provoking language, was wrought to an ungovernable pitch; and in that state, with my senses heated and bewildered by liquor. I unhappily did chastise her with the busk-bone, besides striking her, probably once or twice, with my hand. Whether she received any serious hurt from the fall over the trunk is not for me to say; but sure I am she first complained immediately after she fell. I was told when taken into custody that one or two of my wife's ribs had been broken; now if that be truth, is it not likely they were broke by her falling or stumbling over the trunk. Gentlemen of the Jury, if I had beat my wife with the degree of violence that made it reasonable for me to suppose her life was in danger, should I not have implored the assistance of the doctor when he came by my own order to bleed her. Had I been conscious of inflicting a deadly blow, should I have remained at home with her five days and five nights after the unfortunate affair happened; or if I had suspected danger should I have returned home to my lodgings at the time and in the manner I did. Mrs. Lewellin the witness swore before the Magistrate my wife declared on her death bed she considered herself to blame, and that I would not have beat her at all had she held her tongue. The crime of murder I always held in the utmost abhorrence; and my conscience on the present most destressing occasion is perfectly tranquil, and fully acquits me of the offence I now stand charged with at the bar of this honourable tribunal. I have served my King and Country in the capacity of a private and as non-commissioned officer in the first batalion of the 62d Regiment for a period of ten years, with honour and credit, and if my health had permitted I should at this moment be fighting with my brave comrades the common enemy. GENTLEMEN, I rest confident you will weigh in your minds with the most scrupulous attention the evidence this day adduced against me; that you will look at the cause and origin of the unhappy quarrel. My motives - the provocation: - the state of intoxication we both were in at the time.

I most humbly appeal; confident, however popular clamour may condemn me, a conviction of my innocence, to which I call God to witness, and of your humane and impartial hearing, that you will permit me to submit to your consideration those matters irresistibly attached to the case, which will convey to the Court the impossibility of my guilt. On the contrary, satisfactorily convince you, that so far from committing the horrid act with which I now stand accused, I have uniformly endeavoured by every pacific persuasion to calm the perturbed state of mind under which my late unfortunate wife laboured, and to convey to her feelings,\\ not\\ withstanding her innumerable faults, attachment to her person. Permit to represent, since my infancy, I have pursued a life of honesty and industry; the former part of which was devoted to the service of my country, in his Majesty's ship, Ville de Paris; since which I have pursued every means of procuring an honest livelihood. With solemn grief do I state, I unfortunately married the deceased eight years back, and, for a period, lived happy, enjoying an uninterrupted means by my honesty, confining myself to the humble following of a sawyer; of providing every comfort any well disposed couple might expect, for which I feel grateful to my Maker; when, unfortunately, my wife launched into extravagances impossible for me by my labour to support, continually pledging what few articles I had worked hard for, and contracting debts in every quarter unknown to me, which, however distressing to my feelings, I have, by the most pacific persuasion, painted out the inevitable destruction awaiting such conduct, which, however, only tended to kindle the flame of disaffection, and produced in her new inventions to plunder. Upon various occasions, after having pledged every thing she could move, she has, under various false pretexts, borrowed articles of my neighbours, which she has systematically consigned to the same fate; and, to avoid public detection, she has left her home, and, at the moment when we were entrusted with an infant to nurse, she has carried with her the child's apparel, which she had likely taken from its person a few minutes before, on putting it to bed, when staying out sometimes until one, two, and three o'clock in the mornings, intoxicated, after rolling about the streets, completely disfigured with mud and dirt, she would return; not withstanding all which, I have silently submitted to the same, and afforded her admittance, when she has declared she has lost her pockets, with their contents, amounting sometimes to twenty or thirty shillings; a wilful pretext to enable her to redeem part of the property borrowed of the neighbours, and pledged; a glaring instance of which will be satisfactorily proved by an industrious woman, the mother of the child, who upon some occasions she has actually called from her bed, and persuaded her to accompany her home, to plead in her behalf; who cannot deny, instead of my maltreating her, I have kindly signified my distress of mind at her staying out, and kindly invited her to my polluted bed. Detection upon detection of her infamy followed When at a moment of self-conviction she has absconded, plundering me of every article, not leaving me any thing except the clothes on my back. While at work, instances of which I shall prove by a work-mate of mine, and who unfortunately gave her to me in marriage eight years ago, at Christ Church, Newgate-street, of whom she has repeatedly borrowed money, under various pretexts, to whom, after roving about in a state of whoredom, for a week or so, she has applied to ask forgiveness, and persuade me to receive her; which, upon all occasions, I have, be it known to my weakness, readily complied with, and by other industrious and respectable persons, who have commisserated my fate, to whom she has boasted her finesse in deceiving me about her pockets, and acknowledged her pleasure in my weakness, in believing her. These desertions, with other acts of profligacy, reduced me to a state of wretchedness beyond human conception. My humble home repeatedly deserted, applications upon applications for money she owed, and articles she had pledged unknown to me; incapable of supporting it, although I worked like a horse to support an honest character, in which assertion, thank God, every one that knows me will gladly bear me out; imprisoned, as it were, on the Sunday, by her; as often as I might redeem them, pledging my decent clothes, and often deprived of but one shirt for weeks, I was compelled to form a resolution to restrict her from purchasing our necessary food, &c. by performing such offices myself. This added to her fury; and incapable, by her repeated falsehoods, to deceive her neighbours or acquaintances, as heresofore, she gave way to immoderate passions, and became ungovernable, as often when no person was in her room as otherwise, and I absent at work all day. She would indulge such flagrant passions, often screaming and tearing herself, as one would suppose, to pieces. She would open the window of the room, when she has been known to alarm the neighbours, fearful she might throw herself out. One instance of the latter act can be proved by my landlord and landlady, on which occasion they were induced to rush up and persuade her to descend to her parlour. Sorry am I to repeat these instances of ungovernable passions, but my situation imperiously demands it; and I hope, as my miserable life depends upon your decision, you will humanely forgive me."	975	"notGuilty"

During such absence she applied to a Mr. Smith, in Charterhouse-street, in an apparent state of agony, and informed him, that I had that moment been brought home, by two persons, in a dying state, shewing him an old out-patients ticket for the hospital; under pretext of just having obtained such, and to buy me indispensible and immediate nourishment, borrowed six shillings, and of Thomas Cherverton , a one-pound note. To guard against her organized schemes of deception was impossible; to repeat her actions for the last two years would astonish the most profligate, while it would claim from the dispassionate and philanthropist the tear of compassion and pity. On Saturday, the 24th of August last, as was my invariable custom, I returned home at four o'clock in the afternoon, when my deceased wife being out, I commenced shaving myself. I had scarce finished doing so when she returned, and as if pleased to see her, as I supposed, thoroughly collected, I addressed her by saying, my dear girl, if you continue this way we shall soon overcome our difficulties, and still live happy, when she informed me she had been taken ill in the street, and had reached in her apron, shewing it me at the same time; upon which I expressed my regret, and in as tender a tone as I was capable of, requested her to lay down on the bed, which she did, and to the best of my belief, fell asleep; upon which, having a lock and key to purchase at a neighbouring ironmonger's, for a box I was then having made by my workmate, and also to attend for my wages, I left her three shillings in silver and in halfpence, and went quietly out of the room, fearful of disturbing her."	455	"notGuilty"
"t18120916-52-defend456"	"t18120916-52"	1812	"18120916-966"	66	"I purchased the lock and key, and on going to the sign of the Crown public-house, at which house the sawyers who worked for master regularly met on a Saturday, to make out their bills for the week's work, I called on Mr. Strachan, butcher, in in the Minories, and agreed for the aitch-bone of beef for our Sunday's dinner. At the Crown public-house I met my fellow-sawyer's mate, to whom I gave the lock and key, who, as he regularly did, made out our joint week's bill for work, which bill I took to my employer, who, about half past eight o'clock, paid me, when I returned to the Crown, and paid my mate his portion of the said work-bill. A few minutes conversation passed, when my shop-mates enquired how my wife conducted herself; upon which I informed them we agreed very well, and that I was in hopes, if she continued as she now behaved, I should, I flattered myself, I should by hard-work, be enabled ere long, to relieve myself from difficulties created by her improprieties. Upon which, one and all expressed their conviction. I did not know half she owed. She had borrowed money of every one she could. Amongst the number was my workmate, of whom, during her flight, and about the same time she borrowed six shillings. Of Mr. Smith, she had persuaded him, to lend her one pound, begging him not to acquaint me of the same for a time, intimating, she had pledged my Sunday clothes unknown to me; she wanted to redeem them, and replace them the next day, (Sunday); the whole of which she squandered away during her exile from home, from the Saturday to the following Friday before mentioned. Inclined to be home by my regular hour; called at the butchers, and paid for the aitchbone of beef, which I immediately took home, it being then near ten o'clock. On my going home, to my utter astonishment I beheld my wife intoxicated, and discovered,\\ not\\ withstanding I had left her three shillings, she had taken the gown off her back, and had put on an old bed gown, which, upon enquiry, she acknowledged she had pledged. Disappointed in my hopes of any reformation, I, as well as I could, with a sorry heart, expostulated with her of her innumerable acts of treachery, and the difficulties she had plunged me into; besides acquainted her of the information afforded me by my shop-mates, and very likely chided her in a harsh manner for obtaining the one pound of my mate. Chagrined at my unexpected dectection, she first began to cry, and deny the whole, which hurt me the more. I call God to witness I never struck her. She permitted her passion to overcome her, and most completely terrified me by her screaming, jumping, and knocking about, exclaiming, dear Frank, don't believe them. Upon which she made a desperate attack upon the room door, no doubt to fly out to avoid further animadversions, which I prevented by placing myself before it, in which I believe a scuffle might ensue for two or three minutes, in which I let fall on the floor the aitchbone of beef, having been from the moment of my entrance into the room, and missing the gown off her back, struck, as as it were, senseless. Observing her in such a violent rage, and persuaded my continuing speaking to her would only add to it, I silently set myself on a chair, with my back to the window, at the opposite side of the room, reflecting with silent grief, at my wretched situation; still determined not to let her go out of the room, especially as I was convinced she had been drinking. After screaming and jumping about the room, as if mad, she, unknown to me, flew to the window, which unfortunately was opened, and raised herself upon the sill of the window, and precipitated herself into the yard, paved with sharp pointed stones. Casting my eyes round I first saw her flying down out of the window. Distracted, I rushed down stairs; how, I know not; but, when collected, I found myself assisting my unfortunate victim of self-destruction, from the fatal spot where she alighted, to the step of our street-door. When I discovered blood gushing out of her head or face, suffice it to say, I was completely senseless for a few moments. When she held out her hand to me I embraced it for the last time. She wished me to accompany her up stairs, but Scott, the constable, denied me so doing and took me in custody."	775	"notGuilty"

I must disclose one more act to prove how bent to every species of advantage she was, even during the short time I left her to buy the lock and key, and obtain my wages. She had not only pledged her gown, but had actually borrowed a pair of flat irons of the landlady, and pledged them also: and more wonderful, after she had jumped out of the window in a state, dreadful as may be expected, told her of the same, gave her the duplicate, and requested her to keep this act from my knowledge, and privately gave a number of duplicates to Mr. Smith to keep for her unknown to me."	181	"notGuilty"

Flowers asked me how I did, and asked me to drink, which I did; he said, you are in the habit of working for a great many cabinet makers and carpenters, do you know any body that wants to buy any fine timber; I said I did not. He told me that he had a friend that had a large quantity of it in the Deptford road; he could not get a customer for it, therefore he must go to the King's Bench in a short time. I asked him if any of it was fit for Venetian blinds; he said some was, and some was not. I then told him I was in the habit of working for a person that used a great deal, if he would call on him he lived in Gray's inn lane, perhaps he would buy some of it. He asked me to buy it. I asked him the price; he said he could not tell then, he should see a friend of the owner of the timber, and he would call and let me know. He called the next day and said, his friend said the timber cost twelve pound a load; he told his friend I kept a yard. His friend said, if I could make it convenent he would satisfy me for the room, and for the selling of it. He then told me, that his friend would come along with it, and set a price to the timber himself, if I would consent to it; I consented. The next day, as I was coming from Greathead's yard, I met this Flowers at the corner of Baldwin's-gardens; he told me the timber was at the bottom of Holborn-hill. I told him we should be at the yard by the time the timber got there. As soon as the carman brought the timber to my house, Flowers said, here is my master with it. The carman, Hoads and I, unloaded the timber and got it in the yard. I then asked him how many feet there were of this timber: he said, eighty-three; I set it down on a piece of paper. He said he had made a mistake, there was eighty-four feet; then I altered the figure. The lowest, he said, was ten pound a load, and sixpence a foot superficial. He then told me he would send the remainder to make it up three load the next day: and, if I could sell it, he should be glad: he wanted money very bad, and he expected to be arrested as soon as he went back. The carman, and he, and I, and Flowers, went and drank two pots of porter, and they went away. The next day, about three o'clock, the carman, Mr. Brockelbank, and the officer, came; I was sharpening my saw before they got to the saw-pit; there were four of them. The carman asked me if Mr. Norden was in the shop. I called Norden to come down; he answered me. I asked the officer whether he wanted Newton or Norden. I told him I was the master sawyer. He said, he hoped Mr. Newton and Mr. Norden would behave like gentlemen; I said by all means. He then asked me whether I had not some timber come in yesterday; I pointed to the timber, and shewed him where it was. He said that timber is stolen; I told him I did not know it. He asked me where I got it, or whether it was mine; I told him I did not know the proprietor of the timber; I knew the man who solicited me for yard room for the timber, his name was John Flowers , he was a sawyer, and lived somewhere in the Mint, but where I did not know. He then asked who this man was that I called the proprietor of the timber; I told him a jolly faced man, with sandy whiskers. Mr. Brockelbank made answer, we have got him. They sent for a cart, and I helped to load it; I went with them to the Thames Police. I never saw the man but when he brought the timber, and before the magistrate, in my life."	750	"guilty"

I could not, by any means whatever, attempt to destroy my fellow man in any respect. I never was arraigned at the bar of justice before. I appeal to that Great and Almighty being, before whom I shall one day appear to answer for all the sins I ever have committed, and before whom all the ends of the earth must stand and tremble, at the vengeance of the Almighty. I never did attempt to injure any man whatever. I appeal to him who judgeth the hearts of all men. I have only to say that as I have been sworn against, my punishment, with Cain, of old, is greater than I can bear. I know in whom I have believed. I know that he is able to save to the uttermost. In him I believe, in him I trust. He will never leave me. I therefore commit myself humbly into his hands. If I am transported, my punishment will be death itself. I cannot bear it. My health is in a delicate state. I throw myself at your mercy. These gentlemen, who are to try me for death itself, and therefore, I know, I have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the propitiation for my sins. He has made an atonement for me. I have poured out my soul in prayer to him, who is able to save to the uttermost. I commit myself to your mercy, and look to him on whom you shall look at the great and terrible day of judgment; when all nations of the earth shall stand before him, at whose bar have I pleaded guilty. I know nothing of the transaction of the 6th of May, merely only that all accounts of the 6th of May were settled with Mr. Briggs. I call on Mr. Briggs now, whom, perhaps, in some respects, I may have injured. I am sorry that ever I have injured him. With gratitude I must say in some respects I am indebted to him. Let him go to the utmost extremity, I forgive him freely, for all he has done or said, and brought against me. Man is but a creature of the day, that cannot foresee future events. When left to himself, he becomes fiercer than any beast that roves the woods of Africa or America. Oh, when the spirit of Christ departs from him, what a desperate state must he be in, and I will say, with David of old, let him who thinks he stands, take heed least he fall. Surely wee see with our eyes; the sword is going through the nations of the earth and why are not we awakened. It is our sins we all see, though we are not brought to the bar of justice; for our sins we are securged. Pardon me for taking up your time. I only plead, and ask for mercy. I was tenderly brought up, and lost my father and mother in the infancy of my youth. They were snatched from me. In my situation I have no friends to come forward here in this country. I am friendless and desolate, cast upon a miserable world. I can say no more. I am quite overcome. Let your judgment be tempered with mercy, I beseech it. My prosecutor has not stated what I have done with the one pound four shillings. I kept an accompt in my pocket-book. I don't think I saw him produce that book to see whether there is, on the 6th of May, goods entered. If so, then I must have actually have handed him over the sum.

I told him, I never had been over since July. He asked me to go and drink with him. I do not know the sign; he pointed to the entry, saying, go into the house, and in a few minutes I will come in. I had not been long in this house before a man came in, and asked me if I would go for a sailor. I had two glasses of rum, I asked the girl if I could have a bed. She took me up stairs and shewed me the bed. She charged me eighteen pence. I came down to my liquor. I had not been long there before this young man asked me if I would be a sailor, I thought I was in a wrong place. We hear of kidnapping in the country. I insisted upon my clothes. She fetched them, and said I had not paid my reckoning. I asked for the landlord. She said he was not in. I asked for the landlady. She said she was in the bar. I immediately attempted to go to the bar door. They tore my coat right down my back, and the young man struck me in the face. I received a violent punch on my private parts; I cannot tell by whom. The surgeon knows, ever since I have been in prison it has been a great injury to my health. The man tore my bundle open, and took out a pair of pepper and salt stockings, a sermon book, and a Ready Reckoner. These have never been returned to me. The charge she lies against me is two shillings and sixpence. I sent a friend for them, this gentleman. The officer brought me them. I had my breeches pocket tore, and I lost a one-pound note. I am quite a stranger. There never was one of the name before a bench of justices in the world."	560	"notGuilty"

Mrs. Elvey informed me the place of his abode. When in the shop, Mr. Knight enquired the price of a dressing case, and asked me if I was not in want of such an article, which question caused me to look at one. We looked at one; the price was one hundred and ten pounds. We answered we would call, and give an answer in the morning, having just returned from Brighton. Knight observed to me that we should lose no time. We fixed upon an apartment to have it sent home. Knight advised me to take the name of George Henry Douglas . This was on the 27th, in the morning; the lady of the house not being able to inform us the terms, we deferred taking it till the next morning. We returned to Mrs. Elvey, and informed her that we should have the dressing-case at one hundred and ten pounds, and to look out the pocket-book and other articles, which made it one hundred and thirty-seven pounds thirteen shillings. We then desired her to send it to No. 14, Charles-street; I told her to make out the bill for George Henry Douglas . We returned to Charles street; the lady could give no answer. He observed to the lady that we had some articles coming then for us. We gave in the name of Spencer Pemberton and George Henry Douglas . He immediately returned to the door; a knock came at the same time, the door was opened; Mrs. Elvey came up to us; Knight gave the check into my hands, and without previous excuse left me. Mrs. Elvey and her man went into the parlour; she produced the dressing-case, the bill, and other articles, which amounted to more than she had told us. I gave her the draft; she went away. I ordered the man of the house to take the box to the first coach stand; he did. I put the case on my shoulder; I had not proceeded far in Brompton-row, when Knight asked me for some of the things.

I am an officer in French Army , and served under the Emperor Napoleon in all the battles on the Continent, and in Egypt, where by an ophthalmia I was nearly deprived of my sight, and cannot distinguish any object except by the assistance of my spectacles. On the return of the Bourbon family to the French Throne, I was honoured by having a commission in the Garde De Corps. But soon after Napoleon returning from Elba, and I wishing not to draw my sword against my lawful Savereign, I returned, by the advice of my friends, to this Country, where I remained at bath for a considerable time. In June last, I came to this City to meet some of my brother officers; I took up my lodging at the York Hotel, at which place the innocent cause of my present misfortunes arose. I have been reared in the paths of rectitude and truth by my excellent parents, and am confident that justice for which a British Jury is celebrated throughout Europe, will this day be shewn towards me. I am most innocent of the charge which is imputed to me, and I will in a moment account for this unhappy mistake. The morning after I arrived in London, I received orders with some of my brother officers, to join my regiment; the next morning, I packed up all my clothes, and went to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, but then found the coach had gone off. I returned to the York Hotel to change my trowsers, and without going up into my own room, went into an empty room, which I saw open, and there unpacked the whole of my things in one trunk, as my trowsers were at the bottom; in re-packing them, I suppose it was, that I put up the clothes of the prosecutor's; for as I said before, I am so blind that I never perceived them; I then went to the Golden Cross, determined to sleep there that night, in order to be in time for the coach the next morning. When I went into my room, I put my spectacles on, and on examining my clothes, was greatly surprized to find a coat, waistcoat, shirt, and stockings, which did not belong to me; I could not conceive how they came there, and it was not until I was in prison, that I supposed they came there, by the means I have suggested. I did not conceal them as if stolen, but put them openly out, and locked my trunks. Unfortunately all my papers and trunks have been kept from me, together with a pocket-book, which if I had, I might be able to convince the Court and Jury of the rank I held in the French Army, and of my belonging to the Legion of Honor. I have not a friend in this Country, as all my brother officers are gone. I have only again to repeat my innocence, and place myself in the hands of a British Jury, from whom I am sure I shall receive justice."	556	"notGuilty"

I went down to Woolwich and went on board his ship, knowing some of the crew; and he being a stranger, and a man of my own colour, I asked him to lodge with me when he came to London, which he agreed to. He told me I had better stay on board, for there would be blankets and things which would be throwed away, and as I might as well have them as any one else. When the crew was paid off, he sent one here for half a gallon of rum, and we got all quite comfortable; and when we were coming off, they all made me commodore, and this here Jack, (pointing to the prosecutor) was drunk, and very riotous, and disobeyed my orders; when we came on shore, he would have more rum; I told him I was commodore; I was superior officer, and would not let him, but he would have some, and went and got some. We hired a cart to bring up the chests, and my blankets and things, and we all got on board, and was very merry; but this Jack was drunk and quarrelsome, and would have something to drink, at every public house he came to. After we came up, he changed one note, and gave me the rest to take care of; and went to a cook's shop, and got something for supper; we went into him at the cook's shop, and he wanted to go with girls; we went to a house where there were some, one got one, and another got one, and this Jack made a bargain with a lady, but something was the matter and she went away. I fancy they did not agree. Jack made a row, because she would not stay, and blamed me for it, saying I took her away. At last we agreed to go home to our lodgings; he was very quarrelsome; and in the way pulled out his knife, and swore he would kill me Portugue. I was obliged to knock him down to try to take away the knife, and when the watchman came up, he swore I had robbed him, and I was taken to the watchhouse. He came here to swear away my life to day (addressing himself to the prosecutor.)

I frequently collected perhaps 29 l. in a day, and laid out 25 l. All the money in the concern was Mr. Coakley's. I kept the business together - I wanted 100 l. a year, he gave me 30 s. a week. I was to be advanced as business increased, but I never had that honour, though I made his business to exceed 1000 l. a year, and was always considered to be Mr. Fearman, and was sent by him to attend the opera, and visited every place of amusement with him, and he promised me part of his business. When I left him I was confined by illness, and I told him I was going to live with Mr. Parkes, in Dean-street, Soho; he knew I lived at this house for six months, and never slept from it - I went out every morning to my business. I was told he had a warrant out against me, but knowing my innocence I never absconded. He frequently met me and turned round to look at me, and why not take me, but no, he had not then proved that inveteracy against me which he is so capable of. When his partner died he knew his friends would enter an action against him for burning the old books and making new ones, and at that time I did not countenance him as I did before, and he did not take me to places of amusement as before. I was appointed arbitrator between him and his partner. I met him one night to investigate the books - he bought a new cash book, and said, 'Now I will do them for all their deepness' - he got me to call over the sums - he entered the large ones in the new book, and left out the small ones, then burnt the book. His poor partner was in a dreadful state of mind and came to the shop - he told him the concern was going to the devil, and the business was worth nothing, when it was worth 1000 l. He frequently told me to turn him out of the shop. When he came to enquire when his partner died, and he found I would not countenance him, he charged me with embezzlement.

My Lord, it is my unhappy lot, at the age of seventy-three years, to be put upon my trial, on an accusation affecting my life and character, before a Court and Jury, far distant from my own home, and far distant from the place where even the fact for which I am to answer is alleged to have been committed, instead of being brought to trial before a jury of my neighbours, who know my conduct and character, and (which would be far more important for my interest,) who equally well know the character of my prosecutors. Although I now stand here before the Court, a poor miserable old man, accused of a most base offence. I have in earlier life known the bounties of fortune, I was once in an easy, and I may say, in a wealthy condition; and although by the vicissitudes incident to men, who are highly engaged in commercial concerns, I am now comparatively poor, yet until this accusation was raised against me, my moral character was never impeached, and so all my neighbours would have known, without producing witnesses, if I had been brought to trial before a Jury selected from amongst them."	264	"notGuilty"

In the early part of the year 1815, he was in declining health, and on Sunday, the 30th of April, in that year, I called upon him, as I frequently did. Finding his situation as I thought precarious, and being alone with him, in friendly talk, I asked him if he had made any dispositions of his property, he said he had not, but that he wished his step-mother to have it. At the same time, he added, he would be glad if I would get a will drawn out for him, as I knew he had very strong aversion to any intercourse with lawyers himself, I promised him I would get it done, and accordingly wrote down on a slip of paper his directions, by way of instructions, from which to get a will formally drawn up, and that is the paper which has been produced in evidence. I believe I wrote as nearly as possible in the very words he uttered, I then read them to him, he said it was right, and signed it. I took away the instructions, meaning to get a formal will drawn up from them, and to bring it to him for his signature. At that time I did not consider Mr. Robinson to be in immediate danger, and being particularly occupied the next day, (Monday,) I had not an opportunity of getting the will prepared. On the following morning, (Tuesday,) I learnt that Mr. Robinson had become delirous, and as he never afterwards recovered from that state of mind, I thought it useless to proceed further. The paper remained unnoticed in my possession, as I conceived it a thing of no value, not then knowing or supposing that a little loose memorandum of that sort could have the force of a formal will."	344	"notGuilty"
"t18211205-45-defend477"	"t18211205-45"	1821	"18211205-659"	283	"A day or two after Mr. Robinson's death, another paper was found in his desk, altogether in his own hand-writing, by which it appears, he bequeathed to Mrs. Robinson the purchase-money of a house, he had then lately sold it, and was doubtful whether the papers did not make Mrs. Robinson universal legatee, and I understand, the opinion of Mr. Hart, the Chancery barrister was, that it bequeathed to her the whole of her son-in-law's property. Under this paper, accordingly Mrs. Robinson claimed Mr. Robinson's property, but the will was deposited in Doctor's Commons, by the testator's relations. On hearing these circumstances, I thought the paper which I had written, under his direction, might be important, and therefore I sought for it but was unable for some time to find it, at last, in the month of September following, I happened to discover it among some loose papers, and I immediately gave it over to Mrs. Robinson. Until that suit was instituted, I never conceived that this little slip of paper would in law amount to a will. Gentlemen, in that suit I was called upon to make a deposition, which I did, stating the same circumstances as I have now stated to you; and although that is all I have had to do with the business, I am now called upon to answer, at the hazard of my life, the charge of wilfully having forged that will."	238	"notGuilty"
"t18211205-45-defend477"	"t18211205-45"	1821	"18211205-660"	284	"Gentlemen, I would ask you, what motive I had to be guilty of such a crime? I got no legacy, nor a farthing benefit under the will. There was nothing improper in the conduct of the testator, in leaving this property to his step-mother in preference to his uncle or aunts; for although he was not the actual son of Mrs. Robinson, yet she was married to his father when he was about a year old; and from that time, until the hour of his death, with the exception of a short absence at Shields, he had continued to live with her. She had, throughout his infancy and youth, been an affectionate mother to him, as he frequently acknowledged, and he, apparently, had all the affection of a son towards his mother; insomuch, that it was not till after I was intimate with him for several years, that I learned she was only his step-mother; and indeed, from their conduct to each other, I had, until then, always supposed her to be his natural parent. The paper which was found, altogether in his hand-writing, will sufficiently prove his affection for her. Of his uncle, Thomas, he had often said, he would waste whatever he had; and with respect to his uncle, Richard, it was not at all unnatural that he should overlook him entirely. In truth, he had known nothing of that uncle, who had been long absent at Botany Bay, to which place he had been transported for a felony, which he had committed many years before, when his nephew was not more than a year or two old. This uncle, and his attorney, Mr. Rushworth, and other persons, disappointed of expected legacies, are my prosecutors. I can believe the uncle may be disappointed at the loss of his nephew's property, but it is awful revenge to seek the destruction of my life and character, because I was the unfortunate hand to write down his nephew's last wishes."	329	"notGuilty"
"t18211205-45-defend477"	"t18211205-45"	1821	"18211205-661"	285	"Gentlemen, You will bear in mind that this is not the first time the validity of this paper has been questioned. After a long suit in the Ecclesiastical Court, where all the evidence which my now prosecutors could bring forward to impeach the paper, and shew it to be a forgery, might have been legally heard, and deliberately considered, that Court decreed the paper to be a genuine instrument, and established it as a legal will. Nor did it rest there. Early in the present year, the prosecutors applied to the Ecclesiastical Court, to re-hear the case, but after hearing all the allegations which could be further adduced, the Learned Judge refused the application, and confirmed the former sentence, thereby establishing the genuineness of the instrument."	126	"notGuilty"
"t18211205-45-defend477"	"t18211205-45"	1821	"18211205-662"	286	"Gentlemen, after an ample investigation of this matter, before a Court of competent jurisdiction; I should have thought my prosecutors would have been satisfied of my innocence of the crime which they now allege against me, but you may judge from their subsequent harassing conduct towards me, whether they are actuated by motives of justice, or of revenge, for disappointed expectations. Five years after the will had been established, by the Decree of the Ecclesiastical Court, which was in the year 1816, they preferred an indictment for perjury against me and Mr. Stephenson, at the York Assizes, against me for making the deposition of the facts, under which I wrote the paper, and against Mr. Stephenson for deposing that he believed the signature to be the testator's hand-writing - as these indictments were prefered in my own country, where all the parties were known, myself, the prosecutors, and the witnesses, I readily and cheerfully prepared to meet the charge, but the first delay the prosecutor interposed, was the removing the indictment by certiorari, which delayed the trial for the late then assizes - In dus course, however, they stood for trial at the last York Assizes, in August, and again we were ready to meet the charge, but on the evening before the day of trial, the prosecutors withdrew the records - in the mean time they came to London, and at the last September Session, they presented a bill for forgery against me, before the London Grand Jury, but this bill was thrown out - again in the last October Session, they presented another bill, which is the one I now stand here to answer."	276	"notGuilty"

Consider the disadvantages I am placed under; called upon to answer so heavy an accusation, at a distance from the place where the fact is alleged to have been committed, and before a Jury to whom my former life and character are unknown. Consider too, that my prosecutors have evaded bringing the matter to trial before a Jury of that county, where both they and I are known. Consider also, Gentlemen, that the whole business has been already fully canvassed before a Court of competent jurisdiction, who have patiently heard all that could be adduced against the paper, and that having established it by their decree, they have thereby virtually pronounced that I am Not Guilty of the charge imputed to me by this indictment. But above all, Gentlemen, I pray you to remember the time at which I am called upon to answer for this supposed offence; It is now near seven years since the date of that transaction - in the course of that time, death has removed from my aid three persons who would have been material witnesses for me on this day - Mrs. Robinson, the mother of the testator, Mrs. Stephenson, and Miss Jane Hewson , the two latter were witnesses in the suit, in the Ecclesiastical Court, and spoke to material facts respecting the testator's intercourse with his mother. With regard to Mrs. Robinson, as it is clear I took nothing by the will - it is insinuated I must have had some bribe from her, she rests now in the silence of the grave - death has sealed her lips, and she cannot now give testimony in my favour to prove the falseness of that accusation so long as she lived; no charge whatever was made against me."	318	"notGuilty"

But above all, knowing that there is a God who judgeth the world in righteousness, I cannot believe he will desert me in my old age, and deliver me a victim to the malice of my disappointed enemies."	112	"notGuilty"

Before we left the Pheasant he forgot what he had done with his notes - when I told him I had got two, and the publican one, he insisted on having his notes, and called out murder, and said he would have it back from the publican, but I told him it was impossible till we had been to the coach office. By this time there was a number of people collected together, and I lost him. When I found so many people round me, and not having any pocket on, I put the two notes into my mouth for safety, as I found myself the worse for liquor. The man who took me brought me to the prosecutor, who then swore I had robbed him, but he was so much intoxicated he had entirely forgot giving me the notes to hold."	298	"guilty"

In the evidence, which has been brought forward, you cannot fail to remark the total absence of every thing like positive proof, and that my conviction is sought only upon one or two circumstances feeble in themselves and requiring the aid of strong inference to connect them. I will recall the facts briefly, and first draw your attention to those upon which my prosecutors rely. In the night, between Friday and Saturday, the 4th and 5th of August last, and when eight persons were in my house, it was set on fire clearly by design, and the instrument made use of was a link. It is in evidence that the day before two links had been purchased at an oil-shop, about half a mile distant, by a person habited in a dress similar to one I frequently used to wear, and resembling me in person; the prosecutors assert this person to have been me, and thence infer that I was the author of that fire. Their real evidence does not go beyond this, nothing else applies to me, but I am not the man who purchased those links, and I shall be able to prove this to you. On the night of the fire, a friend had been spending the evening with me, and did not leave me till past eleven o'clock, and I and my wife retired about twelve, leaving our servant to follow. My house was then occupied by myself, my wife, and servant, and my lodger's (who was a Jew) family of four persons, and their servant. On that night the Jew's servant, his sister, and grandmother, slept upon the first-floor, my wife and myself on the second-floor, and my own servant in the back attic. Between one and two o'clock in the morning, a fire broke out in the basement-story, in a closet under the kitchen-stairs, and belonging to the Jews; this fire was discovered, before it had made any progress, by Lazarus, who slept in that part of the house, the very furthest removed from the fire - he alarmed my servant, who awoke my wife and me; the whole house was presently alarmed, and we went down stairs - the fire was extinquished without any difficulty, and was discovered to be occasioned by a link placed in the closet and lighted; Furzeman, the officer, affirmed that he could trace droppings of the link along the passage, from the fire-place, in the Jew's kitchen, to the closet; the Jew's servant had come down-stairs nearly dressed, and had been, a few months ago, suspected of setting on fire a table in the kitchen; this drew suspicion on her; her master, not I, therefore gave her in charge on suspicion of having committed the fire; and she was taken to the watch-house. My wife and servant had sought refuge at the George and Blue Boar inn, and remained there; the rest of the night passed over quietly. - On Saturday morning, Lazarus and myself, and, I believe, most of the persons in the house, attended at Marlborough-street Police-office, on the examination of the Jew's servant. Her master stated his suspicion that she had set fire to the house, and she was remanded for further examination on the following Wednesday, when there did not appear sufficient evidence to warrant her committal on that charge, as the fire had been discovered in time to prevent any serious damage. I did not attach any great weight to it; and certainly thought, with reluctance, of taking the life of an ignorant girl for the crime. I call your attention to the fact that immediately afterwards I wrote to the British Fire-office, in which I am insured, acquainting them with the fire, and the day appointed for the re-examination of the servant of Lazarus, that their solicitor might attend and inquire into the matter. Between the committal of the servant, on the Saturday, and her re-examination, on the following Wednesday, not the least extraordinary circumstance of this mysterious affair was the receipt of two anonymous threatening letters, one by Lazarus and another by myself, apparently by some friend of the girl, accusing Lazarus of knowing all about the fire; the girl has since strongly denied all knowledge of these letters or the writer; they were placed in Furzeman's hand, I believe he still has them; the discovery of the place where the links were bought, by which the fire is said to be communicated, had been an object to all; and on the following Thursday, Lazarus and another Jew, his friend, one Davis, called at my house, and told me they had discovered where the links were bought, and that they were purchased by a man in a grey coat, and with a blue bag. I was glad to hear of the discovery, and they wished me to call with them on Furzeman to consult what was to be done - I was too busy then, but told them I would go on the following day; the next day I went with them to Furzeman's; we saw him, but he was going to Marlborough-street, and said he would go with us to the oilman, at four o'clock. I asked him who the oilman was, who had sold the links, for I did not then know. Furzeman and Davis said. Bradford. I then returned home; the same day a friend, who called upon me, advised me to go and see Bradford - I went with him - he happened to be out - when we got there, we saw his shop-boy, Thomas Dodwell; I told him, who I was, and inquired if he knew the sort of person to whom he sold the links, and the day; the boy said it was a tall young man, about my stature, as far as he could recollect, and dressed in a pepper-and-salt morning-coat, and had a blue bag with him, into which he put the links; but his master had cut down the links, and would know better about them - I and my friend then left. On the following day, Saturday, before four o'clock in the afternoon, the Jew, Davis, called upon me to go to Bradford's - I and my wife went with Davis, and presently we met Lazarus and another Jew - we proceeded towards Bradford's, and I, having my wife with me, objected to go to Furzeman's, but agreed to meet him at Bradford's, which I did in five minutes afterwards - Bradford was questioned, and said he sold two links to a man between eleven and twelve o'clock the preceding day, Friday, and being asked whether he could recollect the person to whom he sold the links, he said, he could not exactly tell, he was more like me than Lazarus, but that he had his face towards the door, and he (Bradford) had only a side view of him - I told them then, I was not out the whole of the day, and could prove it - I was asked by one of the Jews to go home and put on my grey coat, and bring my blue bag with me; I refused, and said, I would not make a puppet-show of myself - we then left - and by the advice of my solicitor, I offered first, two, and afterwards five guineas, to the person who purchased the links of Bradford to come forward, but no one ever appeared; and I afterwards, time after time, pressed at Marlborough-street-office for inquiry and examination; repeated my communication to the Fire-office, and also to that in which the house was insured, and gave to the parish board all the information they asked for. But even without this, mark how every thing tells against my having purchased the links, and how completely I refute the charge - Bradford's, although above half a mile from my house, is within a hundred yards of the house where I was born, and had passed the greater part of my life, and not three hundred yards from the house where I was apprenticed, where I was known to almost every one - and it is singular, that I was not known to Bradford himself - and where my being seen buying these links, would have called forth half a dozen questions at once; but leaving out these improbabilities, it happened I was not out of my own house on the day the links were bought - and particular circumstances make both my servant and shop-boy recollect this, and enable them to be quite positive of my not having been out long after the time the links were hought. - Besides all this, you are to add the absence of all motives on my part; the only one alleged by my prosecutors, is the\\ amountof my insurance - but this motive has been very much misrepresented - the actual value of all my property on the premises, considerably exceeded 2,000l., although that is not equal to the\\ amountof my insurance, and I could not have proved a greater loss, even if I had ventured to claim it - I wish also to draw your attention to this, that it is now three months ago since this fire took place - the purchase of the links was known within a week afterwards, and every fact now urged against me was then known - not the slightest charge, however, was made against me, and a Session at which I might have been tried, has passed. - I do not know the author of the fire - my suspicions I confine in my own breast - but I hope I have proved to you my innocence of the crime I am charged with, and the consciousness of this enables me to wait your verdict without fear - I have been brief in my defence - but I look forward with humble confidence to the result."	1695	"guilty"

Gentlemen, I have invariably had the most ardent affection for my wife, to whom I have been married twelve years and upwards; we have always lived most happily together, until the month of September last, when the prosecutor, by some means or other, began to cultivate her acquaintance; of which I received, from time to time, the most decisive and undoubted proofs; when, of course, that happiness which I had so many years enjoyed in her society, I was deprived of, which affected my spirits to that degree, that I have at times been in a state of distraction; I have, on many occasions, remonstrated with the prosecutor, in consequence of the improper behaviour towards me - indeed, I even found him with my wife, in my own house, which confirmed the reports of my neighbours, as to the criminal intercourse which had been going on for three months between them, - and I feel assured there are several persons in Court who will hear testimony to what I have asserted, and, above all, satisfy you that I have always been considered an honest, sober, diligent, and humane man. I am aware, Gentlemen, I cautioned the prosecutor on one occasion, never to presume to make any overtures to my wife, as he had done before, for the purpose of inducing her to elope with him - otherwise, I held out threats of inflicting that punishment upon him which he richly deserved; but I most solemnly deny that I had any other object in view at the time than that of intimidating or deterring him from visiting my house, and thereby preventing him taking the advantage of my absence from home. At the time, or a few minutes before I was accused of having struck at the prosecutor, I had been taking some refreshment, and the knife I used on the occasion, I could not have been aware I had in my hand, owing to the aggravating conduct of the prosecutor, which so much irritated my feelings as to cause me to strike him, when I must have been in a state of irritation, which was caused by the prosecutor placing himself in my way, laughing and jeering at me, or I could not have committed such a henious offence as that for which I now stand at this bar to answer, and which, should the prosecutor's expectations be realized, will banish me from my native country, or consign me to an ignominious death. Gentlemen, I can only add, that, upon your taking all the previous circumstances to which I have adverted, into your serious consideration, coupled with the evidence which you will hear in support of it, I feel confident that you will say that the injury which the prosecutor has received was not premeditated."	537	"notGuilty"

but in he absence of that, I believe the law is clear on the point that it does not signify whether a man be a licensed or an unlicensed practitioner.; but it requires, and justly so, that a man bring to the work he undertakes to perform, a sufficient degree of intelligence experience and ability I trust, therefore, gentlemen, you will not allow your minds to be swayed against me because I am not a licensed practitioner, but rather let he evidence of those persons whom I have attended, and who will prove the benefit they have derived from my advice determine the point whether I have acted either with gross ignorance or negligence e - it will be necessary for me, as an Hygeist to account you with what are the fundamental principles of Hygeism; which is a peculiar characteristic appellation and which is nothing more than a revival or he ancient system of human pathology and is therefore opposed to what the majority of the medical men of the present day advocate, which is technically called organic pathology or solidism - the former doctrine tracing all diseases to the fluids, and the latter as origionating in the solids; that the blood, if not life itself is the great agent of life, and possess a prominent influence over every part of the body to which it conveys and in which it preserves vitality; and that is the existence of disease must originate injury to a geater or less degree to that vitality, so it must of necessity originate in the corruption or alteration from a healthy state of that blood which is the grand substantiation of he vital principle; the corruption, or disease of the blood, is produced by certain humour which hums are either or both matermine, contagious and person, a that is to say hereditary acquired and original - these humours, which are sometimes more or less local are always when in existence so intimately combined with the blood, as to require the most powerful and searching purgatives in order to effect their expulsion from the blood; but purgative is may be transcendently powerful an yet be composed of such ingredients is to be transcendently pernicious the employment of them with a view to the eradication of one disease, may afford them an opportunity for the creation of another - composed frequently of conflicting materials, these materials may, separating in the body, lose those qualities which they possessed in combination, and retain and expert those evil influences which they individually possess; but purgatives, composed of innocuous or nourishing constituents, are capable of producing (and alone are capable of producing,) those beneficial effects on the blood and consequently on the health, which only purgatives can produce on the former, and therefore on the latter - it is by the use of such purgatives, formed only of vegetable compounds possessing within themselves no deleterious agencies, which decomposition, combination, or alteration, can develop or bring into action (and therefore capable of producing no effect, save that which is desired, and for the production of which they are intended - (that those who practice the healing art accord to the doctrines of Hygienism, successfully endeavour to relive the suffering of their fellow-cretaures - is there anything in these doctrines, or assertions incompatible with reason or propriety? - is there anything incomprehensible to the meanest capacity? - is there any argument or deduction that does not bear on its every feature the impress of truth implicitly and certainly? - I feel that to these important interrogatives every unprejudiced, disinterested mind must respond in the negative - I will now compare the consistent practice and sound principles of Hygeanism with the practice pursued by medical men in general - the Hygerists acting on conviction derived from experience apply one remedy composed of innoeuous ingredients for the removal of all diseases, which, as arising in one body, they consider must originally arise from one cause existing in that body - those opposed to the practice of the Hygeist apply innumerable remedies many of them containing poison in a state of temporary naturalization to the cure of all diseases and of one and the same disease - they also treat local diseases by local remidies, either by internal medicines, which they suppose and are taught to belive, will act particularly on the part effected; or, by external remedies drawing to the surface of the skin by blisters, or diverting the humours from their only, natural course through the bowels by local bleeding - the Hygeists, therefore, practising I unison with their doctrine apply one remedy and believe but one cause to exit; because they find by experience observation and inquiry, that all natural effects flow from some natural cause; and that the removal of that cause it the destruction of those effects which remedy is a harmles vegetable compound la as a purgative to he utter expulsion of all mieals of sufficient strength and searching properties to penetrate and draw out, from the various localities of the human system, all the acrid and corrupt humours which the Hygeists and which their practice abundantly confirms is the only cause of the multifarious forms of disease which afflict humanity-the practice of medical men in applying innumerable and opposing remedies to various diseases afflicting one body, and to one and the same diseases can only be defended on the supposition that the human body unlike all natural productions is no governed by one grand and general agent tor principle; but that although intimately and inseparably connected in al its parts and organs it is wholly distinct, different and unconnected with regard to the pains and infirmities afflicting and impairing the various parts an organs - comparing the principles and practice of both doctrines, it is scarcely necessary to remark that the Hygeists proceed on positive reasoning funded on natural deductions, while those opposed to hem can only account to their practice by negative hypotheses all and totally opposed equally to nature and to reason - thus by a plan of treatment so opposite in its nature, so uncertain in its effects an so injurious in its tendency the lives of hall persons who are suddenly passe from the treatment of the Hygeists to that of the doctors are placed in the greatest jeopardy - and to this mode of treatment pursued in this case, I do most solemnly attribute the melancholy death in this instance - in confirmation of this, look at the thousands and tens of thousands who employ the medicine recommended by the Hygeists in their various aliments; and in no case has an inquest been held, where medical men have not interfered with the beneficial administration of this medicine - in the case before you, I strongly protested, both to the deceased as well as to his friends against their Proceedings fearing at once the evil consequences before stated, an now so lamentably rue - in this nohing can show the absurdity of their practice more than the fact that a man under the influence of an active purgative and his bowel suddenly stopped; and that followed which all reflecting persons must naturally expect, namely infammation - on the contrary had his bowels been kept in a state of solution by the continued exhibiton of purgatives the cause of the inflammation which ensued would have been removed and a return to health he would have been the consequence - this is no chimera - you will ave an opportunity of hearing positive testimony in confirmation there f - I will now shorty state the particular of this case and my connexion with it - I visited Captain M'Kenzie on the 22nd of January by his express desire for the first time after he had the affection of his knee, which was an old complaint of his and which had existed in this instance about ten our twelve days pervious to his\\ send\\ ing for, me and which he state had been brought on by a cold, through getting wet - it consisted of a contraction of the muscles of the knee joint with some degree of swelling and considerable paid - in fact an acute rheumatic affection - I found he had been taking Moraon's pills of his won accord; but now knowing how to proceed with them he sen for me, a and I advised him to the best of my ability and experience - by gradually increasing the doses he got up to twenty of No.1 at night, and thirty of No. 2 in the morning which were the largest doses I ever ordered and never in any shorter time than twelve hocus between, did I order them to be administered the contraction of the knee joint soon gave way to this treatment, and he was sealed to put his leg straight in bed which before could only be in a bent position - so far the case was proceeding satisfactorily with the exception or and increase of pain, but confined wholly to knee - here it will be necessary to mention an important fact, elucidated from the widow, and which was wholly unknown to me before - she stated she did not give the doses I prescribed - so that while I was calculating upon the effect of thirty pills, and judged from the supposed operation of that number, she had only administered twenty and in like manner lessened the various does I have prescribed - hence my administering forty pills to the deceased which was the dose mixed by me illiquid was grounded on the supposed want of power of a much larger quantity than was actually given - therefore, the species of deception coupled with the application of of a blister to the knee unknown to me, all tended to thwart my proceedings - what would he said in the case of a regular medical man\\ send\\ ing his mixture or draught labelled to be give to his patient in a certain way, if the attendant chose to alter the quantity according to their whim and fancy? - would it not be monstrous to charge the doctor with the consequences that minds rise in such a case? - in all probability such dose as forty pills would have been thought necessary had the patient had the number given to him that had been prescribed - Gentleman you must not let your minds be led astray but the apparent astounding number of pills given in this case e - calculating a number of small pills is very erroneous way of arriving at any just conclusion - suppose, for instance, it was worded in this way, 'About a table spoonful of this moisture to be given, 'would it in that case strike your mind as so preposterous? - and yet the same power of medicine would exist - I now beg leave to hand you a powder, which is forty of No. 2 pills pulverised; and I am sure, from the quantity there appears when in powder, and which ha been stated to be two tablespoonsful (but I have no hesitation in saying it would take beyond six hundred or seven hundred pills to fill, when powdered,) it would have a different effect on your minds to forty pills in the whole state - therefore, the only way in which you can arrive at a proper conclusion on the subject, is by paying particular, attention to the evidence of the witnesses which will be examined in my defence - remember that experience is the only test of all knowledge - you will have it in evidence that persons have not only taken the number which was given to the deceased but three times, and even fur times that quantity in one day an the invariable result has been cure - how therefor can it he said that in this case I acted either rashly or negligently, looking a the experience which I have had - it has been argued that if a beneficial effect can be produced by a small number such large doses must of course be injurious - this argument, although plausible, is fallacious for experience(our only safe guide in such matters) aburrdantly teaches us that very large dose of the same medicine does not always produce a more violent effect a smaller one; and that the operation of a drug depends not always on its own intrinsic properties but on the particular circumstances under which it is administered - it will be necessary he to mention the fact acknowledged to me by the deceased, that so far from his being that robust hearty man some of the witnesses would instate, he had repeatedly been laid up with serious illness when abroad - not a very long time back, he was in the hospital, in Jamaica, for three months, with fever and never was able to do without taking immense doses of calomel, above 100 grains at a dose which he acknowledged if he was obliged to continue, would undermine his constitution; in fact, he was a bloated and a very bilious subject - the apothecary states, that he ordered him chicken broth instead of medicine e - of what use could such things be to a man in he state he was while the inflammatory action was allowed to go on unchecked? and that which before was entirely local being only in the knee, gradually extended itself up to he stomach, which was aided by the application of leeches depriving the knee of a part of its resting - it cannot he pretended for a moment that I attended him for again having never received or expected to receive any fee whatever, it being contrary to the terms of publicly offer; nor was the medicine even purchased of me; therefore, nothing but a desire to do him good could influence me in attending him. I will now just draw you attention to what has been sworn against time as as to my representing myself as a regular medical man - when I was informed on the Friday evening that they had called in a doctor I expressed a wish at al events to se the deceased, which the wire refused to allow me to do; and on my still urging the mater she fetched from the next room a person whom I did not then know, but whom I have since learnt, was Captain Allen; he in a very abrupt and unceremonious manner se asked me who I was and by whose authority I had been attending his friend, and if I had my diploma in my pocket; all of which was aid I breath and with great has t - I looked at him with surprise and sarcastically said, 'Do you expect media men are in the habit of carrying this diplomas in their pockets? and as to my authority, I have a grater than any diploma could give me'(meaning thereby, that I considered my experience in this medicine superior to a diploma and which I am sorry to see, they have misconstrued to my prejudice) - and then I said, 'I have attended here by the express wish or Captain M'Kenzie 'Gentlemen I have never held myself out to the world as a medical practitioner; and it must have been perfectly well known to the family and friends to the deceased, that I was only what I ave always represented myself to be an agent for Morison's pills - I then repeated my wish to see the deceased; but he in an authoritative tone, me I should not, unless I liked to wait the arrival of the physician whom he expected very shortly - I replied, I would wait and did a considerable time but no physician made his appearance; and at last, on my urging injustice of preventing my seeing he deceased, who I knew in the morning of that day had every confidence in me, they last consented, and the wife accompanied me to his room when I was informed by the deceased, that it was contrary to his his wish that medical man had been called i, that his friends had insisted on it; and also observed that Mr. Cumming on hearing he had been taking Morison's pills, said he was a poisoned man - knowing the bad effects which usually result from the doctor's treatment following the Hygean, I pointed out to him the folly of allowing his friends to interfere in a matter which so much concerned himself and of their pretending to judge of medicine which they confessedly knew nothing about - his answer was he was obliged to yield there being so many against him; and after taking me by the hand, and expressing in the warmest terms his thanks for my attention, requested that I would see him the following day. You will bear in mind this all took place when, according to the evidence of Mr. Cumming, he was in a state of collapse - I afterwards shortly protested to his friends against the course they were pursuing, and warned them of the probable consequences; at the same time adding the was in perfect safety if left to my treatment, of which I felt full convection - on the following day I went accompanied by Dr. Lynch, but we were positively refused admittance to his room by Mr. Gray and Captain Allen - we then went to Mr. Cumming, and asked him several questions - in reply to which, he said he thought the deceased would do well; but in his opinion, he had been over-purged, and he was endeavouring to give tone to the stomach; and now after bent there days under the doctor's hands his death is attributed tome, gentlemen I have now ben practising with this medicine nearly seven days, and within the last two or three years, the number of persons seeking my advice have increased considerably owing to the success which has attended my labours and in every instance my advice an attendance ha been perfectly gratuitous, Gentlemen, I would ask you, as fathers of families, whether you would not consider it tyranny in the extreme, if the law prevented your giving to your wives or your children, when ill, that which you would have every confidence is, and which you think would restore them to health - and recollect, the same law that would operate to prevent my administering to my fellow-creatmen that which I know will do them good, would also prevent you. Gentlemen I am so thoroughly convinced to the utter harmlsesseness of this medicine, as well as of its power in subding disease in all its shades and bearings that had I a thousand lives wold trust them all to this medicine - and I have reason for such confidence, having received immense benefit from it in my own person; therefore, personal experience is the basis on which I have ventured to administer it to others - I have had occasion severe attack of influenza, to take eighty pills per day; namely forty at nigh, and forty in the morning, an with the happiest results - I have had four of my own children ill of the scarlet fever, al cured by this medicine as well as whooping cough and measles with a variety of there complaints and is no instance has any other medicine been administered; and the result has invariably been successes - this is unlike the medical me, who very sparingly take themselves, or administer to their families, the drugs they send in such plenitude to their patients. Gentleman I call on you well to consider what may be the effect of your verdict in this case - you may, by a just verdict this day establish on a firm footing the medical liberty of the subject or by upholding prescriptive rights, for no other reason than because they have been hitherto upheld, support and perpetuate the most injurious domestic tyranny that can exist in society - give reason and free inquiry on this subject full scope an they will uphold the truth, by bringng false opinions and all the offspring of ignorance, prejudice, and selfinterest before their severe tribunal and subjecting them to the test of close investigation. Gentlemen I ask of you justice - strict an unbending justice - it is not my cause alone, it is as much your own cause - if a monopoly in medical practice be upheld, no improvement can tae place, except from one of their own body - the only verdict which the evidence brought before you will warrant that of ' NOT GUILTY.' and which verdict, I am confident, will alone bear reflecting on by you - in fact any other verdict would be monstrous in the extreme, actuated as I have been by the very best feelings that ca possibly influence the human mid - that of doing my afflicted fellow creatures good - and the experience I have had, both on myself another, fully Justices me in advising the use of this medicine. Gentlemen, recollect that if medical gentlemen were successful in curing their patients there would be no room of the practice I am engaged in, as every on has a prejudice in favour of them, until they are taught by painful experience the truth, that their practices not based on those sound principles which insure success - this system of medicine is now become entirely a party afair - look a the immense power arrayed against it; namely, the entire medical body, which but few honourable exception - look at the influence this body of men have in society - the power the law has put into their hands) - a dangerous power, and one which however right items gone by is not fit to exist now - in many instances have I known in a country town a tradesman persecuted and deprived of his business, by the secret influence of the medical man of he place, merely because he was guilty of the crime to selling Morison's pills while his own medicines might sold with impunity - I merely rmention this to show that if it were not for the intrinsic worth of Morison's medicines in themselves. the opposition arrayed against them by the whole bodily of apothecaries and druggists would be more than sufficient to crush them; and should not the testimony of such men against this medicine of which they confessedly know nothing be at all events received with great caution? The doctors of the present day designate Harvey the great discoverer of of the circulation of the blood, immortal but they know that their medical forefathere considered him quack, and persecuted him because he had been hold enough to declare a great truth which truth was opposed to their preconceived notions - the public are now beginning to see that they are the greatest quacks who cannot cure heir patents; and they the best physicians who can cure them, whether licensed or unlicensed. Gentlemen I leave my case in your hands trusting you with do your duty in the first place to your own consciences, by an unprejudiced review of all the evidence brought before you; by which alone you can do your to that society for which form a part and of which you are hare as delegates. It appears to me there are two points of importance for your consideration in this case; first, was it or was it not a proper medicine to administer in this case? an the next point is was it administered in proper quantities? - a satisfactory answer to this question can only he had from the testimony of of those who have had practical experience in the mater, an snot from he speculative opinions of medical men, who confess they know nothing whatever of this medicine, having never analyse the pills, no have they ever used them - and cannot therefore be acquainted with their effects whether taken in less or in greater quantities, or, indeed, in any quantity at all - and beer in mind, it is not the supposed component parts of this medicine, and which are stated to be different by different chemists but the compound, as a whole, that determines its character."	4134	"guilty"

I trust, my Lord and Gentlemen, that any diffidence I may feel in addressing a public court will be excused; and therefore, embarrassed as I am in this situation, as you will readily conceive I must be, I do take comfort at the kind and patient manner in which you have been pleased to conduct this inquiry - Gentlemen, were this an investigation before a Board of Commissioners, the usual and proper tribunal for such an inquiry, I should have felt no hesitation, but should have looked at it with perfect confidence as a prelude to my immediate exoneration; but summoned here before you, arraigned at the bar of a criminal. court, to be called upon to explain acts of official negligence, or other official acts, whether of omission or commission, has excited very sensibly my feelings, and I hope to be pardoned if I say my indignation - Gentlemen, at the outset I must remind you, that I held the responsible situation of President of the Foreign Post-office, a situation which necessarily gave me the control of every act of duty on the part of the officers of that department - in every case I was authorized to use discretionary power, and to detain letters if there was any doubt as to the accuracy of their direction of the mode of forwarding them - I am accused of having embezzled small sums of money, and not forwarding the same to the Inland Office - all that I can say to this, is that if any such monies came into my hands for any such purpose, they were, with the letters, forwarded to the Inland Office - I say, 'If they ever came into my hands. 'for the first charge bears the date of Wednesday, the 2nd of March, which you have not now before you - on that very evening the Malta, the Buenos Ayres, the Brazils, and the Indian Mails, in addition to the ordinary mails, were made up; and it was with considerable difficulty that they could be prepared for dispatch - I believe the\\ amountof postage received that evening, between five and seven o'clock, equalled, if it did not exceed what is taken on grand post nights, which are Tuesdays and Fridays - but, gentlemen, I am unable to state the exact amount, as an extract from what we term the night charge-book, in which the sums the window-man receives are entered, has been denied me, although I applied by letter to the President for it - my exertions, in addition to the confusion of the evening, may be estimated; for though I was President, and had no obligation to stoop to so menial an officer, I delayed settling the window charges, that I might assist at the sorting table; in fact my presence was constantly required in every part of the office - if I had any letters or money for the Inland Office, I should have sent them there directly, just as I received them, to have kept my table clear - I say, that, not only on post nights, but on every evening, there is an immense pressure of business, and a variety and multiplicity of things to attend to, which it is next to an impossibility that I or any one else can remember, as it relates to every transaction - Gentlemen, it is notorious that Mr. Young, who has been before you, is a very had reckoner; and I, as President, have had very frequent occasions to reprimand him on that account - no account of the transactions of the kind of which I have been speaking are ever kept - many letters going from the Foreign Office to the Inland Office, are completed at the moment out of hand - there is no account kept or taken, likewise, I should mention to you, on the otherwise of the tunnel, the Inland side, of what monies or letters are received - therefore that sum for letters and newspapers, which Young says he believes he gave me (8s. 10d.) on' if you bear in mind, according to his deposition, he had not previously seen those letters - that some letters were found in my drawer is certain, but it is a circumstance that happens to every public officer, and has happened to myself after twenty-seven years of service - can an act; call it negligence if you will, or rather by its true term, call it accident - is it possible that these letters, from among hundreds, nay thousands, were mislaid, and I neglected them purposely? - is it to be concluded that I intended to steal them? - is it intended to say I intended to steal the postage on them? - as to receiving from Arrowsmith or Young the sums of 7s. 8d., (or as I think in my agitation I may be incorrect as to the amount,) I can only say I have no recollection on the subject - Gentlemen, my house was searched, the peaceful abode of my wife and family, and were letters and newspapers found? No - does it not rather prove as strong as proof can be, that the suspicion attached to me is false? - Mr. Young has said that I asked him for 3s. 10d. for letters from the Inland Office; and he stated that he did not give it to me at the time, but he did give it to me about a quarter of an hour afterwards, Now this is important, because there is no proof that he gave it to me at all; and this brings me from half past four o'clock to half past five o'clock, when he tells you I was asleep before the fire, and the letters were in my that - he has admitted to you, that he had not given me the 8s. 10d. before he saw the letters in my hat - has he satisfied you, Gentlemen, how it happened, that he, a public officer like myself, should see, what must have appeared to him a neglect of duty - should see me asleep before the fire with fatigue, (and those letters, which he must admit, if I had the money for them at that time, ought to have gone down the tunnel) - has he explained to you his neglect of duty, in not awakening me and reminding me of mine? But my Lord and Gentlemen, there is the messenger Craddock, a very respectable and steady officer, for what I know to the contrary, and he says he was on duty on Monday evening from five to eight o'clock, and no such letters came through the tunnel - suppose, as might be the case, that I overlooked them at the moment for the night, and that I put them into the tunnel next morning - I do not say that this was the case - I do not, I cannot, pretend to have any recollection of it; but can you believe me guilty of purloining such sums? - is not the smallness of their amount a proof of my innocence instead of my guilt? Gentlemen, need I further trespass on you concerning the present charge - I am convinced I need not - I almost think I hear you saying to each other, 'Can it be possible that this man, who is in the receipt of £500 a year - can it be possible that such an individual could have hazarded his situation for the paltry sum with which he is charged?' At all times, if I was in want of money, I could readily procure it from my friends - can you think that, I who have filled in society the station of a gentleman, a man of education; and estimating at no mean rate the blessings which attend those advantages, with a wife and five children - having the approbation of my constant friend, Mr. Henry Freeling, the assistant secretary to the Post-office - I ask of you - I request - I desire - I implore you, Gentlemen, to look at these facts, and then, can you conceive it possible? - can you conceive it credible, (even put it is a lower grade of words) - that such a man as I now stand before you, after twenty-seven years of service, during which I trust I have been an honest servant of his Majesty - that I could be mad enough - that I could be such a fool as to put my myself - my character - my family - my existence, all in stake for the value of 9s. 4d.?"	1392	"notGuilty"

Now, so far as the evidence goes, that there have been goods stolen, it only amounts to this, that Mr. Morris takes ill something like seven or eight weeks previous to my apprehension, and when he comes back to the shop he finds his goods diminished; and a very likely thing too; there were a great many men at work there, and a great quantity of material used, and it is very likely that the goods may bare been out up in our trade. So much for goods being stolen. Then as to the identifying of the goods. It is all very well telling business men that goods are had out of the stores not marked; we all know it is not so; even our gloves, boots, and everything we get, and the tools we use, are marked with the Government stamp; it is only a trick that is tried to be played upon you, to say that there are goods in the store marked and not marked; but it so happens that the goods in question were given out of Mr. Morris's private store. Then as for my stealing them. The only evidence laid before you that I stole the goods, is that I was entrusted with the key from dinner time till evening; if Corporal Weaver had been here he would have told you that he was at work with me, and also another sergeant, and that I did not go to the stores the whole afternoon, and that I left without any parcel, and that I could not have taken or handled the goods without their knowing it; but the witness, very unfairly, is kept back, purposely, no doubt, that you may not see the rights of the case; I leave it to you, gentlemen, to say whether I did steal the goods, or whether they are the property of Her Majesty. I have great doubts whether they are leather at all; if not, the indictment must fail. I trust you will show by your verdict that the humblest, as well as the noblest in the land, can have justice at your hands, and that you will not send a man to prison solely upon doubts and suspicions, without the least foundation, and without being supported by evidence."	430	"guilty"

I said that I could not think of taking a recompense for it, and I started off without any intention of going to the bank, but I led her to believe I had been, and when I returned, I gave her to understand that the bank had closed, and advised her to give me a written order to receive the money. I thought the matter had dropped; when, on the 26th June, I received a letter from the friend I have mentioned, in which she stated that Mrs. Dillett would be at St. Martin's Church at 2 o'clock; I went and waited for her till a quarter-past 2; she said that she had been waiting for a signal from her husband whether he could attend, that she could see his place of business from there, and that he appeared and gave her a negative signal, and would I sign her husband's name. I said I had no proof that she was the wife of Jonas Dillett, she produced her marriage certificate, and I accompanied her to the bank and signed the receipt. To prove that there was no premeditated act of forgery, I signed the surname incorrectly. I was not asked the question whether I was Jonas Dillett till after I had signed the receipt, when I said that I was not, and immediately despatched Mrs. Dillett, believing that her husband would appear and extricate me, and even if I had received the money I should have placed it all in her hands. It will be suspected that there was an improper intimacy subsisting between Mrs. Dillett and myself, such, however, was not the case, nor anything approaching the case, so that I had no inducement to act as I did. This it a truthful statement, and I trust, when you come to look at all the circumstances, you will believe that, however foolishly I may have acted, I was not intending to defraud either Jonas Dillett or the Provident Institution."	466	"notGuilty"

Later I came to know that one of the partners was condemned to ten years' hard labour for having attempted to put in circulation forged notes. My good faith is proved by being in the company of Mr. Beretta when I changed the notes, and by leaving my address in London. If I had known they were forged I should never have sought the company of Beretta to have them exchanged, especially as he knew me intimately. After two months I returned to London, and continued to frequent the hotel kept by Beretta, who never told me anything about the notes being forged; on the contrary, he received me well; therefore, he could not have suspected they were forged. When I obtained exchange for three of the notes in the City, the clerk went out and returned and said they were genuine; therefore, that confirmed me that they were genuine. I was astonished, when I went to the third money-changer to have two more changed, to be told they were forged. I then gave up all the remainder that I had, my passport, and everything. I had no idea of it before then. If I had been a forger I should have acted in a different way.

I returned to my husband at Boulogne to save him from a divorce. I returned turned to this country again, and my husband followed and broke up everything in the house, saying that all I wanted was a divorce, and that he would not have it. Mr. Turquand wrote letters to my husband at the dictation of Mr. Moon. After that his family persuaded him to leave me. He did leave me. I went to John Moon and asked him to give Frederick Moon a letter for me, and I would never see him again. He said 'No,' and that Sir Francis had determined that no letters should be sent. In the meantime Frederick Moon returned, and it was agreed that I should belong to him; not to live together, but to belong to him; and I have all these years belonged to him. This last year or eighteen months he was always unhappy. He thought he did not see enough of me. He then proposed that I should live with him altogether. He was very unhappy. He then settled that he would be with me. We have been most happy. He was most kind. His whole consideration was my happiness, and I could not have done him an injury. He tried to take the knife from me. I am not sure whether he got it or not. We struggled and fell. I thought at first that I must be the one injured. I found blood on me; warm blood. I said 'Oh, Fred., Fred., what have you done?'Then I found, of course, that it was him, and not myself. I tried all I could to do something to stop it. First of all I applied cold water. Then I remembered that cold water produced blood instead of stopping it. Then I sent for ice and tried that, and then the doctors came. Then, my Lord, you spoke to the Jury that the servants heard a scream, and that there were only so many steps dividing the kitchen from the dining-room. There are two nights of steps; I should think the first one about twelve, the other one about six. Mr. Eccles can answer that. You spoke of the scream. The fact is, the bell rung violently, and the servant, Mary Hale, rang the call-bell.

I was then in the family way again, towards the latter end of the year; my breast was very bad, and after a three weeks' confinement I had to go to the Middlesex Hospital, and remained there four months, and during that time he never came near me to give me even an ounce of tea. The last fortnight he deserted my children, and did not give them a loaf of bread. I had to leave the hospital before my time to see my children. On 5th September, last year, I was taken ill in the street, and taken to the union, and was laid up for a month, and when I came home I found my home gone, and these two living together as man and wife. This time I would not have gone near him, but I wished to see my children. I asked him to leave me the eldest, as she did not belong to him. He said he would do as he liked with her, and I should not have anything to do with her. I went to see her on the Saturday night, and found that my husband had been to the Magistrate making a statement that I only wanted to get her away from her situation in order to pawn her clothes, which was quite wrong; the girl wanted to leave. When I found that I was refused admission to the girl I went and bought this, but not for him; I did not intend to find him at home, as he is generally at the public-house at that time of night. My sister answered me through the door, and defied me to come in; she said she was inside and she would take care to keep me out. I sat on the stairs for a quarter of an hour, and when he came up stairs she called out 'Look out, Amos; there is somebody on the stairs;' he said 'Is there?' I said 'Yes, there is,' and I threw the cup in the darkness. I could not see where I threw it. I then waited till the policeman came. That is all I have to say."	601	"guilty"
